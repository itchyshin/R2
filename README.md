# R2

Revised supplementary files for the paper:

Nakagawa, Shinichi, and Holger Schielzeth. "A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed‚Äêeffects models." *Methods in ecology and evolution* 4.2 (2013): 133-142.

The code includes R2 calculations for MCMCglmm for Gaussian, binary and Poisson data. Also some updates from this paper was included too:

Nakagawa, Shinichi, Paul CD Johnson, and Holger Schielzeth. "The coefficient of determination R 2 and intra-class correlation coefficient from generalized linear mixed-effects models revisited and expanded." *Journal of the Royal Society Interface* 14.134 (2017): 20170213.
